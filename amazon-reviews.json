      "review_text": "The blender feels nice and solid.  It is also very quiet.Tested it by making some sofrito.  While it managed to blend the vegetables (green pepper, onion, cilantro, tomatoes and garlic), it did feel a bit under powered.We had an older hand blender from Braun before and that one had a lid for the mixing cup.  This new one does not which is disappointing.Overall a good blender.",

      "review_text": "Very disappointed, previously had a braun hand blender and it lasted years it was great. The previous one was a type of plastic, so it was very light and easy to travel with. This one is made of steel so it's very heavy, and for about 45 seconds it worked brilliantly, and it's currently being picked up by DHL to return. Very disappointed.",

      "review_text": "When the Braun 7035 went on sale, I grabbed it. I\u2019ve been wanting an immersion blender for years and I decided that this would be the year to get oneafter a big kitchen remodel. I received it today but when I opened the box I found that I had received a 7035X - Multi Quick 7. Or at least that\u2019s what the box it\u2019s in says. The box looked like it had been opened and then re-taped shut. However, examining all the pieces, non of them look used and they are all in their plastic bags.If you look at the back of the box, it shows the 5 pieces I was expecting from the description of the 7035. But in the manual, which also looked like it had been handled quite a bit, it shows an additional black attachment which turns out to be a potato masher, something I\u2019ll never use, and several extra cutting blades for the chopping jar which only came with one blade. Since I have a mini food processor and a regular food processor I would probably not need anything more than the blade that comes with the cup so I\u2019m okay with that too. In fact, the reason I bought this is to use for soups when you need to blend some or all of it, so that I don\u2019t have a hot mess of putting the soup in stages, into my blender to make it creamier. I might try the whipping attachment for making meringues though. We\u2019ll see.I did plug in the blender and attached it to all the pieces and affirmed that they all work and that I can change the speed of the blending by how hard I press the button, so everything works. I\u2019ll find out how well it creams the butternut apple soup I  plan to make tomorrow as I will be breaking up the squash and apple pieces that have cooked for some time.I have a friend who has a Braun immersion blender that she bought 25 years ago and it\u2019s still going strong. And Wirecutter just moved the 7035 to its top spot recommendation for immersion blenders. I\u2019m going to keep the box it came in and the box it was shipped in because I have until Jan 25 to return it if anything goes wrong. I\u2019m okay about not having a potato masher (I like mashing my potatoes by hand with my hand masher, or, we buy the already mashed Yukon gold potatoes at Sam\u2019s Club as they\u2019re tasty and easy to just heat up). And again, I\u2019m fine about not having a bunch of blades for chopping. When I have actually used it a few times this holiday season and cold weather so soup season, I\u2019ll edit my review. The box might be used or had just been poorly handled but the equipment inside looks new. Manual looks used though. It\u2019s so confusing!",
