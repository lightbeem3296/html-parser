Really good work!



I had a thorough look at the first example. This is the product I chose:

I need these additional attributes in the response please:

** list_price = this is missing only discounted price is there
** description = (it's incomplete, I've attached a screenshot, in this example only 1 line is missing but in others whole paragraph is missing.)
** reviews > verified_purchase = True or False based on whether the review has that written next to it
** total_reviews = int value based on the written reviews value I have added a screenshot from this product and the html file
** retailer_badge = High Satisfaction Item (or equivalent text in element at similar location)
** features = list (entire list of features)
** dimensions*= there's a separate list of dimension. If the dimensions list has a different 3rd name then we can club the lists into the features list
** country_of_origin = text (in this example it's there maybe in others too)
** product_guides^ = link to the pdf instruction manual when present (it is there in this example)
** buying_offers^ = (the pay later or discount offer in a list of strings)
** addon_offers^ = info about warranty purchase pricing I have added a json with this example
