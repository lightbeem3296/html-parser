So I thought I would like to have them in the freezer again. I was so disappointed. First of all, they shrunk, in length and girth. The flour tortilla was more like a pie crust. And there was maybe a spoonful or two of filling. Just awful. So next I tried one in the microwave instead of the toaster oven. That made the tortilla somehow slimy. And once again, hardly any filling. In the garbage the remaining \"burritos\" go.",
